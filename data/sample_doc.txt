Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching computers to learn from data. 
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

Python is the most popular programming language for machine learning and data science.
Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand human language.
Large Language Models like GPT and Gemini use transformers architecture for text generation.
